\section{Introduction}
Extractors are algorithms that convert a weakly random distribution into an almost uniform distribution by using additional truly random bits. The author showed how to construct such an explicit extractor using a particular pseudorandom generator construction. This construction improved on the previous constructions and was simpler than them. Since pseudorandom generators are known for computational indistinguishability, using its construction to show a connection to an explicit extractor which guarantees statistically close distributions was an interesting idea that this paper explored.

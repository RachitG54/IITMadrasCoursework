\section{Follow up work by Raz, Reingold and Vadhan}
After Trevisan's paper was published further work was done by Raz et al \cite{Raz:2002:ERR:637554.637559} who devised an improvement on their constructions. Along with some bound improvements they also have an improvement on the running time of the algorithm from $poly(n,2^t)$ to $poly(n,t)$. They state that Trevisan’s extractor performs poorly when one wants to extract more than a small fraction of the randomness from the weak random source, or when one wants to achieve a small statistical difference from uniform distribution. They give two ideas, the first idea allows one to extract more than a small fraction of the randomness from a weakly random source. The second idea improves Trevisan’s construction in the case where the output bits are required to be of a relatively small statistical difference from uniform distribution.

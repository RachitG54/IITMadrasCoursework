PART-1
The output for the s - box no y are in 'outputs' + y. Where first u see the sbox mapping, then you observe the linear cryptanalysis table, then the differential cryptanalysis. Then we observe the other properties of the s-box for each output bit.
The same can be obtained from the code by specifying the s-box values as input in the crypt.py file. 

To run : python crpt.py, running takes 10-20 seconds as the analysis was over an 8X8 matrix. 

The sage.py contains the code for the sage server computations, i.e to calculate galois field inverse. To run those copy sage.py contents to sagecell.sagemath.org website and run.  


PART-2
The code for finding the best trails can be found in trailslin.py for linear cryptanalysis and in trailscrpt.py for differential cryptanalyis. There output can be seen in o2 and o respectively.

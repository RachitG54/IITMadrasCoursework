Q1) 
Output and Input specifications are as asked by the question, the client prints the required options on the console.


Q2) 
Program asks for a filename and the number of bytes from the user, the filename asked must not contain the @ character as that character acts as a demilter seperating the filename and bytes in our message to the server. 
The client recieves sorry if no file is found in the server directory or it simply prints the required bytes in a new file where it overwrites the file if it exists. 
The filename of the output file is 1 concatenated with the input file name.

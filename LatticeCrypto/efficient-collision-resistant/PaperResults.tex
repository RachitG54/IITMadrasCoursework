\section{Paper results}
They formulated a reduction showing that for cyclic lattices of prime dimension $n$, the short independent vectors problem $SIVP$ reduces to (a slight variant of) the shortest vector problem $SVP$ with only a factor of $2$ loss in approximation factor. They note that factor of loss in approximation is not trivial and the prime dimension constraint is not restricting. For general lattices, the best known reduction loses a $\sqrt n$ factor \cite{Micciancio2002}; furthermore, that reduction performs manipulations on its input lattice that can destroy the cyclicity property. Hence their reduction can be seen as the first connection between SIVP and SVP on cyclic lattices.

Also in using the Gaussian techniques of \cite{Micciancio:2007:WAR:1328722.1328733}, they also establish a new bound on the discrete Gaussian distribution over general lattices, which may be of independent interest.

Their main result is that certain instantiations of the generalized knapsack function are collision resistant, assuming it is infeasible to approximate the shortest vector in cyclic lattices up to factors $\tilde O(n)$ almost linear in the dimension $n$. The construction is also efficient as noted in the previous section. To motivate their choice of knapsack function, they also show that Micciancioâ€™s original one-way function is not collision-resistant, nor even universal one-way.

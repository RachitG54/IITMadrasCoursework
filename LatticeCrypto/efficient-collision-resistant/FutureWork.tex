\section{Future Work}
In the same year Lyubashevsky and Micciancio \cite{Lyubashevsky:2006:GCK:2097282.2097300} obtained exceedingly similar results but expressed them in different mathematical language. In particular, by making
many of the same algebraic insights, they constructed collision-resistant hash functions with nearly
identical parameters, based on a worst-case hardness assumption that was similar to the paper studied. They also presented a more general algebraic framework for constructing hash functions, which can be related to problems in algebraic number theory. Due to its generality, their framework may have the potential to admit better constructions, though its current best application essentially matches the collision resistant function considered here.

A more practical instantiation of the function considered here was presented in \cite{Lyubashevsky:2008:SMP:1425852.1425858}. They propose a collection of compression functions that are highly parallelizable and admit very efficient implementations on modern microprocessors. Their constructions were supported with a detailed security analysis of concrete instantiations, and a high-performance software implementation that exploits the inherent parallelism of the $FFT$ algorithm. They claim that the throughput of their implementation is competitive with that of $SHA-256$, with additional parallelism yet to be exploited.

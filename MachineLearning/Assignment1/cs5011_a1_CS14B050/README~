The python code files are as follows:
1)Code for Q1, Q2, Q3 is in file Q1.py.
2)Code for Q4, Q5, Q6 is in file Q2.py.
3)Code for Q7, Q8 is in file Q3.py.
4)Code for Q9 is in file Q4.py. 

1)Q1.py generates DS1.csv and DS1_labels.csv denoting the DS1 dataset.
2)Q2.py generates Q4data.csv which is the data without first 4 columns and contains missing values initially filled with mean (you can fill it with median and random values by changing array in savetxt function). The independent variable are stored in DS2.csv. And dependent variable in DS2_labels.csv.
Also generated are CandC−train<num>.csv and CandC−test<num>.csv for num = 1 to 5. and contain data with the dependent variable and are split 80:20.
The coefficients for linear regression for all 5 splits are stored in Q5coeff.csv.
The coefficients for linear regression for all 5 splits are stored in Q6coeff.csv.
Each vector for a new spit is on a new line.
3)Q3.py generates Q73dplot.png.
4)Model, result generated by proffessor Boyd's code.

\section{Remarks}
We observe that the polynomial method used mainly works along the lines of two observations:-
\begin{itemize}
	\item A polynomial of degree d has at most d roots. (Schwartz zippel lemma is a generalization of this).
	\item Given a set S such that $|S| \leq d$, there exists a non zero univariate polynomial of degree at most d that has set S as its roots. (Used to show existence of a $g$ that has the kakeya set as its roots). 
\end{itemize}

\section{Remarks}
Along with the undirected case, the authors also studied this problem in the directed case. In the directed case they were able to prove that every digraph is $2$-weight choosable. But the conjecture still remains open for every connected undirected graph.

The paper showed yet another novel application of the combinatorial nullstellensatz method.

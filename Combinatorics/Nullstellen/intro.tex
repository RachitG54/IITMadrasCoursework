\section{Introduction}
Combinatorial nullstellensatz is an algebraic tool developed by Noga Alon that can be used to prove results in various fields ranging from combinatorial number theory, graph theory to combinatorics etc. In this summary we summarize the results and comment on the various application of combinatorial nullstellensatz mentioned in the paper.
